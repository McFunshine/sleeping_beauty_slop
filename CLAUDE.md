# Team Collaboration Guidelines

## Git Workflow

### Before Making Changes
- Always pull the latest changes: `git pull origin main`
- Merge any conflicts if they exist

### Before Pushing
- **ALWAYS ASK BEFORE PUSHING** - Get explicit permission from the user
- Pull and merge first: `git pull origin main`
- Resolve any merge conflicts
- Only push after getting confirmation

### Commit Guidelines
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused on single features/fixes
- Don't include "Claude" or "AI-generated" in commit messages

## Development Practices
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Check for linting/type checking commands before completing tasks
- Run tests if available
- Keep the codebase clean and well-organized
