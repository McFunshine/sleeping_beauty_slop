S1 Domain-speciﬁc Question Answering
We conducted an additional evaluation question that examined AgentD’s ability to extrapo-
late mechanistic ﬁndings to broader therapeutic contexts by asking about the implications of
combining ABT-199 and proteasome inhibitors for treating solid tumors compared to hema-
tologic malignancies. This question tests the system’s capacity to synthesize domain-speciﬁc
knowledge and provide clinically relevant insights beyond the immediate scope of the ref-
erence paper. Figure S1 shows the actual responses from both AgentD with RAG and the
standard GPT-4o model to illustrate these diﬀerences in clinical reasoning and mechanistic
understanding.
We evaluated responses using the same Weller et al. study, which primarily focuses
on the mechanistic basis of drug synergy through NOXA upregulation and MCL-1 inhibi-
tion.S1 While this question extends beyond the paper’s direct experimental scope, it remains
grounded in the mechanistic principles described in the work. Both AgentD with RAG and
the standard GPT-4o model were asked to discuss the therapeutic implications for diﬀerent
cancer types.
The RAG-augmented response demonstrates superior clinical reasoning by directly con-
necting the paper’s mechanistic ﬁndings to therapeutic applications. AgentD correctly iden-
tiﬁes that the combination could “signiﬁcantly impact the treatment of both solid tumors
and hematologic malignancies” through the dual mechanism of direct BCL-2 inhibition and
indirect MCL-1 inhibition via NOXA activation. Importantly, the response provides speciﬁc
examples, noting eﬀectiveness in “solid tumors, such as soft tissue sarcoma” and established
eﬃcacy in hematologic malignancies including “chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple
myeloma.”
The RAG response captures the key therapeutic insight that this combination approach
could “overcome resistance mechanisms involving MCL-1,” which aligns closely with the
ground truth explanation that the strategy “could potentially overcome intrinsic resistance
mechanisms in solid tumors that are less dependent on BCL-2 but still rely on MCL-1 for

Domain-specific question:
What are the implications of the findings regarding the combinatorial use of ABT-199 and
proteasome inhibitors for treating solid tumors compared to hematologic malignancies?
The findings indicate that combining ABT-199 (venetoclax) with proteasome inhibitors (PIs) could
significantly impact the treatment of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In solid tumors,
such as soft tissue sarcoma, this combination synergistically induces apoptosis by activating the pro-
apoptotic protein NOXA, which inhibits the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1, enhancing ABT-199's efficacy.
This dual action—direct BCL-2 inhibition and indirect MCL-1 inhibition—suggests effectiveness in solid
tumors overexpressing these proteins. In hematologic malignancies, where ABT-199 is already effective,
particularly in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and multiple myeloma, combining it with PIs could improve
outcomes by overcoming resistance mechanisms involving MCL-1. These findings support further clinical
evaluation of this combination in various cancers, potentially expanding therapeutic options for both
solid and hematologic malignancies.
AgentD (w/ RAG):
The findings on the combinatorial use of ABT-199 (venetoclax) and proteasome inhibitors have several
implications for the treatment of solid tumors compared to hematologic malignancies. Here's a
breakdown:
1. Mechanistic Synergy:
Hematologic Malignancies: ABT-199, a BCL-2 inhibitor, is particularly effective because these cancers
often rely heavily on the BCL-2 pathway for survival. When combined with proteasome inhibitors, which
block protein degradation, the apoptotic pathways are further enhanced, leading to increased cancer cell
death.
Solid Tumors: These cancers might not be as dependent on BCL-2 as hematologic malignancies.
However, the combination could still disrupt protein homeostasis and induce apoptosis by targeting
multiple pathways.
2. Clinical Efficacy:
Hematologic Malignancies: Clinical trials have shown promising results due to the high BCL-2
expression. The combinatorial approach can enhance responses in resistant cases.
Solid Tumors: The efficacy might be more variable due to the diverse nature of these tumors and their
reliance on other anti-apoptotic proteins like MCL-1 or BCL-XL.
Resistance Mechanisms:
Hematologic Malignancies: Resistance can develop through mutations or upregulation of alternative
survival pathways.
Solid Tumors: The diverse genetic landscape means multiple resistance mechanisms could limit
effectiveness.
3. Toxicity and Side Effects:
Combining ABT-199 with proteasome inhibitors can potentially increase toxicity, necessitating careful
dose optimization and monitoring in both cancer types.
4. Biomarker Development:
Identifying biomarkers to predict response can help tailor the combination therapy more effectively,
particularly in solid tumors where response rates might be heterogeneous.
5. Future Research Directions:
Continued research is needed to understand the specific tumor types and settings where this
combination is most beneficial, and to develop strategies to overcome resistance in solid tumors.
Overall, while the combination has shown efficacy in hematologic cancers, its application in solid tumors
requires a nuanced understanding of tumor biology and careful clinical evaluation.

survival.” This mechanistic understanding is crucial for clinical translation, as it identiﬁes
the speciﬁc molecular rationale for why the combination might succeed where single-agent
BCL-2 inhibition fails.
In contrast, the standard GPT-4o response, while comprehensive and well-structured,
provides a generic framework that could apply to virtually any combination therapy discus-
sion. The response covers broad categories such as “mechanistic synergy,” “clinical eﬃcacy,”
and “resistance mechanisms” but fails to reference the speciﬁc NOXA-mediated pathway
that makes this particular combination therapeutically promising. Critical omissions in-
clude the ISR activation, ATF3/ATF4 transcriptional regulation, and the speciﬁc role of
MCL-1 inhibition in overcoming resistance.
The standard response does acknowledge that “solid tumors might not be as dependent
on BCL-2 as hematologic malignancies” and mentions reliance on “other anti-apoptotic
proteins like MCL-1 or BCL-XL,” but it lacks the mechanistic foundation to explain how the
combination speciﬁcally addresses these dependencies. This represents a missed opportunity
to provide actionable clinical insights based on the underlying biology.
Furthermore, while the standard response discusses general considerations such as toxic-
ity management and biomarker development, it does so without the mechanistic context that
would guide these clinical decisions. The RAG response, by contrast, grounds its recommen-
dations in the speciﬁc ﬁndings about NOXA upregulation and MCL-1 inhibition, providing
a more targeted foundation for clinical development.
This evaluation demonstrates that even for questions that extend beyond the immediate
experimental scope of the reference literature, RAG-augmented responses maintain superior
clinical relevance by preserving the mechanistic foundation that underlies therapeutic poten-
tial. The ability to connect speciﬁc molecular mechanisms to broader therapeutic applica-
tions represents a critical advantage for biomedical question answering systems, particularly
in translational research contexts where mechanistic understanding directly informs clinical
strategy.
